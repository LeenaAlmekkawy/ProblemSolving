249 is not divisible by 2 because the last digit, 9, is not even.

Divisible by 3:
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3.
372 is divisible by 3 because 3+7+2 = 12 and 12 ÷ 3 = 4.
218 is not divisible by 3 because 2+1+8 = 11 and 11 ÷ 3 = 3 2/3.

Divisible by 4:
A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits are divisible by 4.
312 is divisible by 4 because 12 ÷ 4 = 3.
334 is not divisible by 4 because 34 &divide 4 = 8 1/2.

Divisible by 5:
A number is divisible by 5 if the digit is 0 or 5.
325 is divisible by 5 because the last digit is 5.
314 is not divisible by 5 because the last digit is, 4, is not 0 or 5.

Divisible by 6:
A number is divisible by 6 if it is even and is divisible by 3.
